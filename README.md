# A set of Docker containers for local Drupal development.

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/flight-deck/badge/?version=latest)](http://flight-deck.readthedocs.io/)

Flight Deck is a set ofÂ Docker containers for local Drupal development. It is lightweight, simple, and Docker and Kubernetes-native, allowing you to stand up a local development environment quickly after installing Docker.

## Deployment on Kubernetes

Flight Deck is configured out of the box to run in production on Kubernetes. For the easiest deployment, consider using the [`ten7.flightdeck_cluster`](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ten7/flightdeck_cluster) role on Ansible Galaxy. There's extensive documentation in the [project's readme](https://github.com/ten7/ansible-role-flightdeck-cluster).
